    - **First Screen (#ffffff)**: White text is likely used for the main title displayed on the overall background, offering high contrast and prominence.
    - **Popup Window (#212529)**: Titles within the popup window itself use a dark gray, providing a more subtle contrast.
- **Buttons & Icons (#00c6bf)**: A vibrant light blue is used for button and icon. This distinct color makes them visually appealing and encourages user interaction.
- **Background (#f2f6f8)**: A very light gray sets a clean and airy backdrop for the popup window's content.
- **Borders (#cccccc)**: Light gray borders create a subtle definition around input elements on the popup window, separating them from background.
